[Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) is the study of how the nervous system develops, its structure, and what it does. Neuroscientists focus on the brain and its impact on behavior and cognitive functions. Traditionally, neuroscience has been seen as a branch of biology, but it has grown to encompass a wide range of interdisciplinary fields that work together toward elucidating brain function at multiple levels of investigation.
